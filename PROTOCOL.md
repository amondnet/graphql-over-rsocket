A request for execution should contain the following request parameters:

- {query} - A Document containing GraphQL Operations and Fragments to execute.
- {operationName} - (Optional): The name of the Operation in the Document to execute.
- {variables} - (Optional): Values for any Variables defined by the Operation.
